# Digital Garden - An Interactive Plant Life Simulation

## ðŸŒ± About The Project

Digital Garden is a mesmerizing web-based simulation that brings to life the subtle beauty and complexity of a self-sustaining garden ecosystem. Unlike traditional games or simulations, this project focuses on creating an ever-evolving, living canvas where plants grow, reproduce, and interact in fascinating ways.

## âœ¨ What Makes It Special

- **Natural Life Cycles**: Each plant in the garden has its own unique lifecycle - from seed to maturity, reproduction, and eventual fade. Trees grow tall and majestic, flowers bloom with vibrant colors, and grass creates a dynamic ground cover.

- **Dynamic Weather System**: The simulation features a weather system that directly impacts plant growth. Sunny days provide steady growth, rain accelerates it, and cloudy conditions slow things down, creating a more realistic and engaging environment.

- **Intelligent Plant Spacing**: Plants use sophisticated spacing algorithms to ensure they don't overcrowd each other, mimicking natural competition for resources. Different plant types maintain different spacing requirements, just like in nature.

- **Organic Reproduction**: Mature plants naturally drop seeds within realistic spread radiuses, with trees spreading their seeds further than flowers or grass, creating natural-looking plant distributions.

- **Interactive Controls**: Users can:
  - Adjust simulation speed to watch evolution happen faster or slower
  - Fine-tune plant spacing parameters
  - Add new plants manually
  - Clear the garden to start fresh

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

The project uses HTML5 Canvas to create smooth, efficient animations and beautiful visual effects. Each plant type has its own distinctive appearance:
- Trees with broad canopies
- Flowers with colorful blooms
- Grass with varying heights and shades

## ðŸ’­ Philosophy Behind the Project

This project was born from a fascination with emergent systems and natural processes. It demonstrates how simple rules can create complex, beautiful outcomes - much like nature itself. The garden serves as both a meditative visual experience and an educational tool, helping users understand concepts like plant lifecycle, spacing, and environmental factors in plant growth.

## ðŸš€ Future Vision

The Digital Garden is an ongoing project with room for endless possibilities:
- New plant species
- Seasonal changes
- More environmental factors
- Enhanced visualization options
- Plant evolution mechanics

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS, the project demonstrates that beautiful, complex simulations can be created without heavy frameworks or libraries. The modular design allows for easy expansion and modification.

## ðŸŒ¿ Get Started

Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser to start your own digital garden. Watch as it grows, evolves, and creates unique patterns every time you run it.
